jDoctest
~~~~~~~~

jDoctest is an useful test library for JavaScript that was inspired by
`Python`_'s `doctest`_ module. It finds testable examples within your
JavaScript files and checks if each example runs successfully.

No more you need separated test files or documentation files. You only need *a
single file* which contains an executable source code, documentations, and
testable examples.
