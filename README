jDoctest
~~~~~~~~

jDoctest is an useful test library for JavaScript that inspired from
`Python`_'s `doctest`_ module. It finds docstrings and test examples from your
JavaScript file and checks if each examples are succeeded.

No more you need separated test files or documentation files. You need *only
one file* which contains an executable source code, documentations for
reference, and test examples.
